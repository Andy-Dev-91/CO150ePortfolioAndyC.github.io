      <p>My readers should be familiar with my identity and the lessons I have gleaned from my personal setbacks. I am particularly proud of my understanding of the research process. Next, I must complete the backend and JavaScript on my portfolio website. Subsequently, I will learn how to host it on the internet through GitHub Pages. I would appreciate it if my peer reviewers could concentrate on the structure and content of my memo to ensure that it effectively communicates its intended audience and purpose.</p>

      <p>With the semester almost over there are many stressors that are currently going on. I have 3 major finals and 2 huge projects that need to be finished. Another stressor that I have is finishing the planning for my vacation after finals are done. Making sure flights are confirmed, hotel arrangements are made, and if my spouse will be able to get around the cruise ship in her wheelchair. I am looking forward to the warmer weather for the few days we will be out at sea and being away from the modern stressors of every day life. Spending time with family is what I want to do most over my winter break. </p>

        Deepen Experience in Writing:

        Use Sources and Evidence:

        15 min writing sprint

        During my writing process I felt that the revising stage was one of the most effective portions of the A3 exercise. During revision I was able to find errors in my writing and was able to make dramatic improvements to the introduction of my essay.

        2 - What did not work well was some of the mistakes that I made during my research and how my overall thesis changed several different times, this translated into me doing more research on adjacent topics. I will also use my time more wisely and not procrastinate on my next major assignment.

        3 - The most helpful comments that I received during the peer review process was to have a more interesting hook and to change the structure of my into paragraph, I believe this helped   bring the reader more. All of the critique that I received during workshop was great

        4 - I feel just okay about my essay because I did not use my time as wisely as I thought. I feel like some of my thoughts were just scattered around and hopping from one thesis to the next. I think that I should have found one more popular source that was against my stance.

        5 - The skilled that I developed the most during Unit 3 was increasing my experience in the writing process. I talked extensively with my spouse about the topic and performed a lot of research on AI and how it is impacting the workplace. The skill that I need to develop the most is the research process and the use of sources of evidence.

        6 - The goal is to want to set for myself on the next assignment is to have a deep understanding of WHY we are doing what we are doing and to produce great work. I am also looking forward to finishing the portfolio website and getting it online.

      <p>Audience Objections

        For my essay I wish to have a conversation with labor organizations that work directly with people that work within the tech industry. I believe that their motivations are to help tech employees and to ensure that they are protected from bad business practices. What I hope to achieve is to bring awareness to the lack of junior development talent and the lack of opportunities	that are available to them. Their motivations could differ from the current

        - My audience will most likely react poorly to the current position that I have. Tech companies will challenge my idea of keeping junior talent within their companies because it will cost more money and more time and resources to train them and get them up to speed with the current technologies they are using to build their products. An assumption that my clam could make is to limit technological advances in the field of AI, this is not the case. My claim has to do with the protection of tech employees and not have them become redundant just

        - One piece of evidence they could scrutinize is how AI is making developers more productive and how profits for tech companies are at an all time high. They could also question that my sources are just OPINION articles that have no real research presented with them. Some evidence the audience would find to be convincing is presenting how much more productive a software developer is when they have access to to AI tools that help them code.

        - The counterargument that could be presented is how profits and productivity are at an all time high and how company morale is the best that it has ever been. This counterargument is valid, because all three points are true statements. Profits are up, productivity is up. I think that I will need to continue to preform additional research to have a better understanding of how profits are up, but also laying off thousands of employees every quarter. Could that be where most of the profits are coming from? I will need to make sure that I present my argument in a productive manner instead of something generic like “corporate greed is bad”</p>

      <h3>A1 Reflection</h3>
      <p class="date">September 16, 2025</p>
      <p>During the peer review workshop I received a lot of critique that helped make my personal narrative better. The most challenging part of the peer review workshop was the time management aspect. I found it difficult to read my paper, and then peer review 3 others within the time of one class period. It was great having commenter access to my groups papers, this made leaving comments and suggestions quick and easy for my classmates to review. The feedback that I found most helpful was my peers informing me that I did not reference Dweck/Carr in my original rough draft, which was a major part of the assignment. During the next peer workshop I would like to have smaller groups, a maximum of 3 students.

        Throughout the writing process I have been employing as many writing techniques that we have learned here in class as much as possible, such as remembering who my audience is, and writing a “shitty first draft”. These things have worked for my writing process so far, but there is definitely room for improvement.
