      <h3>A1 Reflection</h3>
      <p class="date">September 16, 2025</p>
      <p>During the peer review workshop I received a lot of critique that helped make my personal narrative better. The most challenging part of the peer review workshop was the time management aspect. I found it difficult to read my paper, and then peer review 3 others within the time of one class period. It was great having commenter access to my groups papers, this made leaving comments and suggestions quick and easy for my classmates to review. The feedback that I found most helpful was my peers informing me that I did not reference Dweck/Carr in my original rough draft, which was a major part of the assignment. During the next peer workshop I would like to have smaller groups, a maximum of 3 students.

        Throughout the writing process I have been employing as many writing techniques that we have learned here in class as much as possible, such as remembering who my audience is, and writing a “shitty first draft”. These things have worked for my writing process so far, but there is definitely room for improvement.
