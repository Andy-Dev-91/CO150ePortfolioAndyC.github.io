    <h2>Personal Narrative (A1)</h2>

    <p>
      This page presents my Personal Narrative (A1), which reflects on an experience where I experienced failure and the lessons I learned from it.

        Rescue Randy, in his robotic voice yelling “Help me, Doc!” while he is bleeding artificial
        blood from two amputated extremities. Lights constantly flashing in a dark and crowded room,
        the smell of gunpowder from blank ammunition. Suddenly the lights turn on, the sound of gunfire
        stops, the proctor of my hands on exam tells me that I failed to check and see if Rescue Randy
        was alert and breathing, step number 2 in the combat medic treatment algorithm. The proctor
        then signs my hands-on skills packet and instructs me to return to the courtyard outside. Shame
        and disappointment in myself were the first 2 feelings that came to mind. “How could I forget
        something so simple, so early?” I asked myself. After walking outside, the Drill Sergeant that
        was in charge of my squad asked me how the hands on skills exam went. Without displaying my
        disappointment in myself I answered “Drill Sergeant, I failed the final skills exam because I did
        not perform step 2 in my treatment algorithm and check if Rescue Randy was breathing and
        alert!” The Non-Commissioned Officer took my skills exam packet, looked over it quickly and
        handed it back to me saying, “Well, at least you know where you messed up. I guarantee that
        you won’t make the same mistake twice. Go to Delta squad and practice with them.”

        I immediately fall into Delta squad and introduce myself to the other soldiers, then ask if
        anyone wishes to continue training for the hands on skills test. Private First Class Darce
        responds to me almost immediately, eager to continue his training. We both fall out of formation
        and move towards the neatly organized medical equipment that is approximately ten feet behind
        us. We greet each other quickly and PFC Darce asks if he can start first. I lay on the concrete of
        the outside courtyard and Darce then begins to provide medical interventions, exactly as we
        were trained to do. PFC Darce checks for alertness and breathing, then performs a blood
        sweep, checking to see if there is bleeding in the anterior and posterior of my torso, looking for
        signs of a mock gunshot wound. I let him know I have not suffered a GSW and he moves on to
        the next step of the treatment algorithm, checking for amputation and bleeding of the arms and
        legs. I inform Darce of my mock injury, an amputation of my right arm, right above the elbow.
        Darce immediately reaches for my Individual First Aid Kit and pulls out both tourniquets that are
        included in an IFAK. He begins to put the first tourniquet on my right arm as tight as he possibly
        can, below the shoulder, just like our instructors taught us. The second tourniquet is placed
        approximately 3 inches above my elbow, cutting off the circulation to my arm and making my
        hand go numb in a matter of seconds. Darce moves on to the next step of treatment and once
        again checks my breathing and airway, seeing if my respirations per minute has deteriorated. I
        start to make gurgling sounds, mimicking the sound of a patient that has a blocked airway. Once
        more PFC Darce reaches into my IFAK and finds a nose tube and lubricant, quickly ripping the
        lubricant package and applying it on the nose tube. Darce then inserts the tube into my left
        nostril, allowing me to breathe once again.The last stage of treatment begins, I am given an IV
        of saline fluids, rolled on to a litter so that i can be moved around easily and finally using a
        portable radio to make a mock casualty evacuation. We then look over our packets to make
        sure all steps were followed while removing the medical interventions placed during training. We
        continue to practice our medic skills on each other throughout the afternoon, making up more
        complicated injuries to challenge each other's skills.

        I knew while training for my position in the army that failure was not an option, and I
        practiced until I was sure I would pass with no problems when the time came to retest. A lot was
        on the line for me, if I was to fail the skills test for a second time then I would have to begin the
        process of looking for other military jobs, along with losing out on my contract signing bonus.
        With my new friend by my side a few hours later, the Drill Sergeant approached and asked “Are
        you two ready to try again?”. We both snapped to parade rest, standing up straight, with our
        hands behind our backs and responded “Yes Drill Sergent!” with as much motivation as
        possible. Darce walked back into the building first, leaving me with the Drill Sergeant. After the
        door closed, Drill Sergeant asked to look at my paperwork once more and then asked me again
        if I was ready and if I remembered where I had messed up. I gave him the same answer as
        before. Shortly after, my new friend came back outside, giving me a sly thumbs up to let me
        know that he had passed. Before I stepped back into the training room, the Drill Sergeant told
        me “You know where you made the mistake last time, you won’t make it again. Remember your
        training and stay calm.” “Yes, Drill Sergeant." I responded once more, marching into the medical
        training room, ready to pass my medic exam and be awarded the job of combat medic.
