        SUBJECT: Reflective Memo on my growth as a student and writer
      </p>
      <p>
        Dear Professor Halseth,
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this memo is to reflect on my growth as a writer and student throughout
        this semester in CO150. When coming into the course I had a limited understanding of how
        much writing depends on research and rhetorical awareness. Over the semester I learned that
        writing is not just about putting words on a page to complete an assignment, but about making
        writing choices based on my audience, purpose, and evidence. During this course and another
        class that required research and major writing assignments I developed more confidence in my
        writing skills and better understanding of my learning process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The course outcome where I saw the most improvement was using sources and
        evidence, such as selecting and evaluating appropriate sources. Before this course I was not
        familiar with the process of properly citing a source or how to tell if a specific source was useful
        to my research. Previous research assignments felt overwhelming because I did not know how
        to properly read research articles. During Unit two and three I learned how to use the library
        databases to locate peer reviewed sources and decide if they supported my arguments. This
        course helped me to understand that research is about finding the right sources instead of
        finding as many sources as possible to support my claims. As a result of this class I feel more
        confident working on research based assignments. This course outcome is important for my
        future writing because many of my upcoming courses will require research papers, lab reports,
        and projects that need reliable evidence. In my day to day life these skills have helped me better
        evaluate sources of information such as news and videos online.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another course outcome I engaged with and want to continue developing beyond this
        course is deepening my experience in writing, with a focus in generating ideas, editing drafts,
        and proofreading. I struggle at the start of large projects when it comes to generating ideas. I
        have also had a bad habit of focusing too much on minor things like grammar. The “Shitty First
        Drafts” reading by Anne Lamott helped me understand that I was wasting time attempting to
        have perfect sentence structure and that I should let my ideas flow freely and that there is
        always time for corrections later. Moving forward in my studies I want to improve my
        brainstorming and spend more time in the editing and proofreading process so I can further
        deepen my experience in writing
      </p>
      <p>
        The reading from Bad Ideas About Writing that stood out to me the most was “You Can
        Learn to Write in General” by Elizabeth Wardle. In the reading Wardle explained that you
        needed an audience, a purpose and the context if you wanted to write anything. This idea
        helped me understand the information I will need for all my upcoming writing assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        This semester taught me a lot about myself as a student and writer. Most importantly, I
        need time to develop my ideas. Peer feedback can be a very useful experience and helps me
        see my work from a different perspective. As a student, I learned that I need to break my
        assignments into smaller steps and have better time management to help me feel less
        overwhelmed. This will change how I approach future assignments by forcing myself to start
        earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, this class helped me grow into a more confident and effective writer. I
        made the most progress in using sources and evidence, brainstorming is an area I will continue
        to develop. The skills I have learned in this course will continue to improve my academic career
        and I look forward to developing my personal career with these skills in the future.
      </p>

        Very Respectfully,
        Andrew “Andy” Chrismer
